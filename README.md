# qperformance

**qperformance** is an app to quickly calculate the performance of Bible Quizzers on all question types across multiple rounds. It processes `.csv` logs generated by QuizMachine along with corresponding `.rtf` question sets, providing a detailed performance analysis of individual quizzers.

**Looking for the command-line version?** Check out [qperf_cli](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli) for all the same functionality in a command-line interface.

## Getting Started

### Downloading Pre-Compiled Builds (Recommended for most users)

Compiled binaries of **qperformance** are available for most platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux!
Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperformance/releases) page to download the latest version.

**What about Windows/Linux on ARM?**
- We have an ARM build for Linux, but I don't have a device to test it with, so I don't know how well it works.
- Windows on ARM has a compatibility layer to attempt to run x86 programs, but I haven't tested this yet.
Testing and feedback on both of these is appreciated!

**Command-line**: This version uses a graphical interface that is easier for most users. If you prefer a command-line interface, check out [qperf_cli](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli)

### Building From Source (For Developers)
If the pre-compiled versions don't work on your machine or you're using a platform like macOS or ARM-based devices, you can build `qperf_tauri` from source.

**Prerequisites**

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) must be installed on your system.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) must also be installed.

**Build Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_tauri.git
   cd qperf_tauri
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   
3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   pnpm tauri build
   ```

5. **Run the executable** from the `src_tauri/target/release` directory.
